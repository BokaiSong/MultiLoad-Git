# MultiLoad-Git
Source code for our paper “Domain-decomposed Physics-Informed Neural Network for One-dimensional Soil Consolidation under Multi-step Surcharge Loading.” It implements a subdomain PINN for staged loading, supporting forward prediction of pore pressure dissipation and inverse estimation of the consolidation coefficient from sparse data.
